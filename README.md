# DemoConfig
Demo WPF application with styles, triggers and recursive control building in an xml data app.

![Screen Grab](https://github.com/uvatmvf/WpfXmlDemo/blob/master/Images/Capture.PNG)
This demo is meant to bridge Windows FORMS to Windows Presentation Foundation. If you are used to working 
in WinForms, this shows an equivalent implementation pattern for recursive form building and manually wire-up of data binding.

DISCLAIMER: This application does WPF intentionally wrong to maintain consistency with WINFORM development as a learning tool to 
bridge from the deprecated framework to the monitor.

See Animation Sample https://github.com/uvatmvf/Animation for an MVVM WPF application sample.
